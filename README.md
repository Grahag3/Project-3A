Known issues:

1. There is still no volume control or leaderboard, as these mechanics seem to somehow destroy my mind more than anything.
I also believe that the system I use for sound in my games does not work with the volume control I was hoping to use. I am extrememly sorry
that these 2 important factors are yet again missing, but I don't even know where to start. I will be asking for assistance on these mechanics
moving forward so I can implement them in the final games.

2. There is a slight possibility of the game crashing if you happen to fire just as your last life is lost. Please just restart the game if this happens.

3. There may be a possibility that the music will not play. I think this only happens if you build the game, and I'm not sure why it does.
