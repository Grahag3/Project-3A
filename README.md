Known issues:

1. Score doesn't work, but only sometimes. Also the player is awarded no points for the scattershot bolts destroying enemies. We'll call this a feature because really that weapon is overpowered.

Inputs:

WASD or arrow keys to move, space to fire primary weapon, left shift to fire scattershot.
